# Saad Fahmi's Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive terminal-based web portfolio! ðŸš€  
This project is a creative and engaging way to showcase my skills, projects, and personality using a web-based terminal interface.

## Features
- **Interactive Terminal Interface**: Mimics a Linux terminal for a unique and nostalgic user experience.
- **Command-Based Navigation**: Users can type commands like `help`, `whois`, and `projects` to interact with the portfolio.
